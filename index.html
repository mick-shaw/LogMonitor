<p>LogMonitor is a simple powershell script used to
monitor a tomcat log file.</p>

<p>I'm using it to monitor an IVR application written in
Avaya's Dialog Designer.  The problem is that periodically
the ODBC connection drops and cannot be restablished
until the tomcat service is restarted.</p>

<p>This wasn't the ideal solution.  However, the IVR application was
written by AVAYA and I became tired of the internal DBA saying it 
was Avaya and Avaya saying it wasn't their code.  Since 
I was caught in the middle, I wrote this script to monitor the 
tomcat logs and look for the error signature that causes 
the application to stop writting to the external DB.</p>

<p>When a socket error is logged the Application sends an email
notification of the event and restarts to Tomcat service to
restablish the ODBC connection.</p>
