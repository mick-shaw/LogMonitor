The problem is that periodically\r\nthe ODBC connection drops and cannot be restablished\r\nuntil the tomcat service is restarted.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't the ideal solution.  However, the IVR application was\r\nwritten by AVAYA and I became tired of the internal DBA saying it \r\nwas Avaya and Avaya saying it wasn't their code.  Since \r\nI was caught in the middle, I wrote this script to monitor the \r\ntomcat logs and look for the error signature that causes \r\nthe application to stop writting to the external DB.\r\n\r\nWhen a socket error is logged the Application sends an email\r\nnotification of the event and restarts to Tomcat service to\r\nrestablish the ODBC connection.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
