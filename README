LogMonitor is a simple powershell script used to
monitor a log file

I'm using it to monitor an IVR application written in
Avaya's Dialog Designer.  The problem is that periodically
the ODBC connection drops and is cannot be restablished
until the tomcat service is restarted.

This wasn't the ideal solution.  However, the IVR application was
written by AVAYA and I became tired of Avaya saying it wasn't their
fault.  Since they wouldn't change their code, I wrote this
script to monitor the tomcat logs and look for the error signature
that causes the application to stop writting to the external DB.

When a socket error is logged the Application sends an email
notification of the event and restarts to Tomcat service to
restablish the ODBC connection.
